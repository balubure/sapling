# TODO:

## Next

* Twigs!
  * Whether a branch has leaves
  * Or perhaps a 'minLevel' for leaves
* Leaf shape
  * Redo rake calculation
* Redo color gradients
  * Simplify to two colors
  * Add gradient direction
  * Add color jitter
* Color hex edit
* Help pane?
  * Descriptions for properties?
* Uniform leaf sizes for non-monos
* Flat leaves (i.e. independent of branch direction)
* Leaf droop based on gravity
* Bark material?

* I need a way to be confident that I won't lose designs as I make more.

* Leaf Gradients.
  * Gradient length

# Bugs

* Double-check log scale formula.
* Finish log scale for range props
